# C# Projects

These are some small projects I made using C# and >NET Framework

## Projects:



```bash
Car Insurance
Twenty One Game
```

## Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. IT takes user's input
on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin
page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued. 


## Twenty One Game

This is a data visualization application that is meant to store and display cards from the card game 21. 
It is an MVC web application that utilizes Entity Framework 6 for 
data access and a Code First workflow. It is still a work in progress.
